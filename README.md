## Analyses

All code used for our main study analyses can be found in the `/analyses` directory. Analyses for the test-restes reliability study can be found in the `/test_retest` directory. Some scripts may call functions and stan scripts found in the `/functions` and `/stan` directories.  
The analyses steps are structured as follows:

#### 0 Simulation study

Code used for a simulation study to validate the models included in our model space. Presented in the Supplementary material 1. 

#### 1 Data processing

Processing raw data for both the main data collection and the follow up data collection, including cleaning of individual questionnaires according to questionnaire manuals and applying exclusion criteria. 

#### 2 Descriptives

Descriptive data analyses including demographics, psychiatric comorbidities, task metrics, and questionnaire measures. 

#### 3 Task - model agnostic

Model agnostic analyses of task data. 

#### 4 Task - model based

Model based analyses of task data, includes model fitting, checking for model convergence, model validation, and posterior predictive checks.

#### 5 Main analyses

Main analyses as described in the first pre-registration (see https://osf.io/2x3au). 

#### 6 MDD HC comparison

Exploratory analyses comparing subjects meeting criteria for current major depressive episode to age and gender matched healthy controls. 

#### 7 Circadian analyses 

Main analyses investigating circadian effects, as described in the second pre-registration (see https://osf.io/y4fbe).
